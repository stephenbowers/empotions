      <p className="history">
        EmPotions is founded on the passion to heal through nature and magic.  The building sits where a medical clinic once stood in the 1600s.  It is a space with a history of pain and healing.  We have atuned ourselves with the spirits of that past that still wander the area.  Many guests of the cemetary across the street pay us visits.
